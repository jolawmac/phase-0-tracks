<!--1. The purpose of html tags is to let the browser know which set of code to display and when to display it and how to display it. The most important tags are the header, main, and nav tags. I feel like these would be used most often. Along side those would be the aside tag. Most website I visit have aside tags full of ads, etc. I think the nav element is very important. There's probably not many websites that dont use the nav.
2. The order the browser uses to display the elements is from top to bottom. The first thing the browser reads would be the type of HTML like DOCTYPE. Then the HTML tag followed by the header, article, nav, main, body and so on. Usually the information on the webpage can be separated by importance or by sections using the elements. What the author of the webpage considers most important should come first followed by various other elements. The example the flowchart on html doctor shows is the best example: nav, article, aside, figure, section, etc. 
3. We learned how to create snippets which are portions of code that can be saved for later use and easy access by tapping the TAB button after typing in a portion of the code. I believe I'll be using this in the future to help make life easier when working on bigger projects. 
4. Overall, HTML is pretty easy to understand. I thknk practice makes perfect. What would help me is more practice. I believe spending some time on a site like code academy or code school would help me improve HTML.
