# It took me a while to figure out methods in the previous lessons. 
# Not enough time on this lesson to figure it out. 
# I think the last two weeks have gone very quick and not enough time to fully grasp methods. 
# I need more time!


# I know eventually I'll need something like the following:
#	when :+ then puts x + z
#   when :- then puts x - z
#   when :* then puts x * z
#   when :/ then puts x / z
#   when :% then puts x % z
#   else
#   puts "invalid input"
#  	end
